# Enhanced Asset Management for Municipal Corporations

## Problem Statement
Municipal corporations manage a diverse range of assets, including infrastructure, vehicles, equipment, public buildings, and parks. Efficient management of these assets is crucial for ensuring public safety, optimizing maintenance costs, and improving the quality of public services.

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop innovative solutions to enhance the asset management capabilities of municipal corporations. The goal is to create a system or tool that can help municipalities better track, maintain, and optimize the use of their assets.

## Objectives
### 1. Asset Tracking and Inventory Management
- Implement a digital system to catalogue and track all municipal assets.
- Utilize technologies such as IoT, RFID, or GPS (for movable assets) for real-time asset tracking.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for asset data entry and retrieval.

### 2. Predictive Maintenance
- Create algorithms to predict when assets will need maintenance or replacement.
- Schedule maintenance activities efficiently to minimize disruptions.

### 3. Resource Allocation
- Optimize the allocation of resources (e.g., personnel, equipment, budget) for asset maintenance and management.
- Develop tools for budget planning and expenditure tracking related to asset management.
- Implement decision-support systems to prioritize critical asset needs.

### 4. Data Integration and Analytics
- Integrate data from various sources (e.g., sensors, maintenance logs, financial systems) into a centralized platform.
- Use data analytics to gain insights into asset performance and utilization.
- Provide visualization tools for easy interpretation of data by municipal staff.

### 5. Community Engagement
- Incorporate features that allow citizens to report issues with municipal assets (e.g., broken streetlights, potholes).
- Develop a portal or app for the public to track the status of reported issues.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Express.js
